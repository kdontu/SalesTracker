I have followed instructions and tried to develop a working solution. 
I developed a winforms application in Visual studio 2022 using sqllite
It gets data from the database, maps data through middle tier and displays all entities in grids.
Update Product works fine with known issue.
Work in Progress: Create Sale backend logic is 70% complete. The create sale form is visible but not functional yet.

I still need to write use cases, perform unit testing, add logging, exception handling, better error messages etc..
Enhancements:
It can also be done using MVC, web apis and async apis, develop azure services, use SOLID principles and dependency injection etc.. 
But I did not have enough time to use all those technologies properly.

I did not get time to work on the quarterly commission reports yet.
